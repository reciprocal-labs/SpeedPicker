SpeedPicker is a Competitive Lockpicking Platform that simultaneously times competitors picking identical locks and outputs the result to a webpage.

## Usage
The Raspberry Pi hosts an open wifi network with no passthru called **SpeedPicker**. After connecting, the webapp is hosted at **speedpicker.local** and by default is configured for four competitors. To start the timers, make sure all locks are in the horizontal position and press the *green* button. To stop the timers, press the *red* button. All code running on the device itself can be found at github.com/reciprocal-labs/SpeedPicker. SSH access is also available with the default creds *raspberry:pi*.
