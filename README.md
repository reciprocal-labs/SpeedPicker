# SpeedPicker
SpeedPicker is a Competitive Lockpicking Platform that simultaneously times competitors picking identical locks and outputs the result to a webpage.

## Usage
The Raspberry Pi hosts an open wifi network with no passthru called SpeedPicker. After connecting, the webapp is hosted at speedpicker.local and by default is configured for four competitors. All code running on the device itself can be found at github.com/reciprocal-labs/SpeedPicker. SSH access is also available with the default creds raspberry:pi.
